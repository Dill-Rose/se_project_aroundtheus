**Intro**

This project is made with a responsive design so that all of the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. Some techniques that were used to make this happen are grid, flexbox, media queries and relative dimensions. To improve the project, one idea that could be implemented is adding a hover effect to the photos to show the user a brief description about the location.
